/*
Inside the LEXICALLAKE immediately-invoked function expression, you'll find a global variable named explorerAnswer that appears nowhere else in the file. It could belong to cavesofclarity.js or explorerentries.jsâ€¦ who knows? Each time the variable is used, the entire scope chain is checked. You can help us achieve better performance with your knowledge of global usage in modules!

First, import the explorerAnswer global by passing it as a parameter at the very bottom. Then, pass answer as the parameter to the function keyword at the top. Lastly, replace explorerAnswer with answer inside the local function scope.
